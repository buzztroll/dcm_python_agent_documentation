Installation
------------

   There are 2 ways to install the Dell Cloud Manager python agent:

   1. **Interactive mode** - you are prompted for a subset of the available installation options.

   2. **Non-interactive mode** - you specify the desired options as command line arguments.

   In addition there are optional environment variables that you can set prior to installing the agent which affect and direct the installation and allow further custom installs.

   Installing the agent requires **root** authority.
